## Overview 

<a href="https://developer.vimeo.com/api"><img src="images/ic_vimeo2.png" align="right"></a>

Watch the worldâ€™s best videos from the <a href="https://developer.vimeo.com/api">Vimeo</a> community.  Like videos and add videos to your watch later queue. Now you can cast videos to your TV.

In order to run this project, you must <a href="https://developer.vimeo.com/apps/new">Register Your App</a> to get proper credentials such as client_id, client_secret, client_redirect_uri.  
The vimeo_state is needed to <a href="https://developer.vimeo.com/api/authentication#generate-authenticated-tokens">generate an authenticated token</a>.  The cast_app_id can be generated by 
creating a new application in the <a href="https://cast.google.com/publish">Google Cast SDK Developer Console</a>.  Then you can store these credentials into `/res/values/defaults.xml` . 

Otherwise you can just download the .APK in <a href="https://github.com/lawloretienne/Loop/releases">Releases</a>
